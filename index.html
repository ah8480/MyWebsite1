  <h1>What is the world cup?</h1>
  
  <p>The World Cup in football is a quadrennial tournament of 32 men's national teams it happens every 4 years, that is organized by the <strong>Fédération Internationale de Football Association</strong> (FIFA). It determines the sport's men's world champion.</p>
  
  <h1> How was the world cup created?</h1>
  
  <p>The first World Cup took place back in 1930 in uraguay, and was proposed by Jules Rimet, who wanted to create an international competition between men's football
    teams</p>
  
  <h1>World cup 1930 in Uraguay</h1>
  
  <p>The first world cup (1930) took place in uraguay there was 13 teams and there was 4 groups and one of the groups had 4 teams and the rest had 3 teams. Uraguay won the 
    world cup vs argentina 4-2 the goal scorers for argentina where: Carlos peucelle and Guillermo Stabile. For Uraguay where: Pablo Dorado, Pedro Cea, Santos Iriarte and
    Hector Castro</p>
  
  <h1>World cup 2022 in Qatar</h1>
  
  <p>This world cup was honeslty the best (in my opinion) because I went to one of the matches which was: Brazil vs Serbia the game ended 2-0 to Brazil. In the World cup I was supporting
    Argentina but I am happy that i at least went to one match. The final was so fun it was Argentina vs France and Argentina won,the goat (Messi) got to lift the world cup 
    it was his dream. The  score was 3-3 (4-2), the goal scorers for France where: Mbappe x3 (hattrick)
